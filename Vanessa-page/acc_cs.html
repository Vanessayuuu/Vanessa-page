                        <h2>Self-learning on Computer Science</h2>
                        <p>I have been learning computer science for several months from the courses held by HarvardX, an online learning initiative by <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> on the platform <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>. The course, "CS50's Introduction to Computer Science", is the recorded lecture videos of a comprehensive university course so that I can learn more details and background knowledge about computer science and programming. I have also learnt with the help of many online resources and books. Some lab and problem sets are required to submit after each lecture. Welcome to take a look of my coding works on my GitHub profile at <a href="https://github.com/Vanessayuuu" >https://github.com/Vanessayuuu</a>.</p>

                            <p>This course is about hardware, internet, multimedia, security, web development and programming. I learnt lots of background knowledge about computer science through this course which makes me understand more about how the computer and the Internet work. <a href="https://vanessayuuu.github.io/My-First-Webpage/profile/index.html">My first personal website</a> was created during this course.</p>

                                <p>I can understand that my knowledge and skills on computer science and programming are at beginner level. However, I am truely desire to learn continuously and improve my skills and knowledge in this field. Wish that I can eventually become one of the professionals among this industry. I am certainly ready for any challenges!</p>
