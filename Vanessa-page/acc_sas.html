                        <p>At 2017, I was studying at College of International Education (CIE). I gathered a team of committees to establish a division society for students of applied science division. The members of our committee had been changed several times before the society was offically formed. 10 of us in the above photo were the official committees.</p>

                    <div class="container">
                        <p>As the college did not have the official procedures to establish a new society, the committees and I framed and prioritised the establishment procedures. We spent several months to coordinate with Program Director and Course Coordinators to balanced the demands between the college and our committee. These experiences attributed to my commuication and interpersonal skills. At the same time, I needed to work with and lead my team as a president. Thus, my leadership and management skills had also been improved.</p>

                    <p>We set up a booth to promote our society to students. Our committees helped to manage the booth in between of our lectures. At that time, most division had their own division society but applied science did not. Therefore, our promotion focused on telling our fellow students how a division society can help to support science students. Set up study group was our scheduled plan to help with their study as the goal of most students of associate degree is to enter university. Other events was also planned for connecting science students, for instance, camping and theme party.</p>

                                <p>Establishing a society was not easy especially every one of us worked very hard on study of associate degree (we all wished to get into university a lot!). Our team needed to use our spare time to do the society work. As the president, I needed to manage a team of 10 people, guided and motivated them to achieve our goal. This is a precious experience for me to work with a team, as well as being a leader.</p>
