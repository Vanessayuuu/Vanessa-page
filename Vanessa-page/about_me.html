                                    <h3>Hello, I am Wing Yee YU from Hong Kong</h3>
                                    <p class="lead">Computer science is the field that I am currently exploring.</p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>I have been learning several programming languages with the courses held by the HarvardX through the online platform edX. I have got the foundation skills of the languages includes C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Computer science is a brand new field for me as I studied biological science for my bachelor degree. I found it very valueable as it is closely related to our modern life. Everyone of us spend loads of time on our smart phone and the Internet, don't you?</p>
                                    <p>Let me introduce myself a bit. I am a detail-oriented person and love dealing with logics, which is quite suitable for me to enter the industry of computer science. As a teamplayer, I enjoy to cooperate with teammates or even other parties since communication is the best way to satisfly most of the demands from different stakeholders. When I was studying at the College of International Education (CIE), I gathered a team of committees to establish the Society of Applied Science (SAS). As the college did not have the official procedures to establish a new society, the committees and I framed and prioritised the establishment procedures. We spent lots of time to coordinate with Program Director and Course Coordinators to balanced the demands between the college and our committee. As the president, I guided the committees to accomplished our work at different stages. I gained lots of opportunities to build up my leadership skills and communication skills to work as a team.</p>
                                    <p>On the other hand, I am used to work on my own between two discussion stages because it is also significant for every team member to work on whatever have been discussed. While working on my own, I can stay focus to work on my target issue. I am also an initiative person, feeling excited to learn new skills. Whenever facing some challenges, especially while studying new knowledge, I always try to solve the issues with various resources such as searching from the Internet or even ask for guidance from people in the related field. My current target is entering the IT industry as my career. I am looking forwards to learn more about the related skills and make contribution in this field.</p>
